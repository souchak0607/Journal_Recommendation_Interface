"# Journal_Recommendation_Interface"
The jupyter notebook version of the work is available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ELBjq0wW5oJfhKg4JQuIxR0uMLi04AXq?usp=drive_link
We have made the jupyter notebook files available initially used for our given work:

    1. JournalRecommendationFinal_with_paraphrased.ipynb - This is the basic jupyter notebook version of our proposed pipeline.
    2. OutputAnalyzing.ipynb - This is code for analysing the outcome of the pipeline and to evaluate the results efficiently

The module based coding files of our propsed pipeline will be made available soon.
